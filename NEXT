#      Match   Introduces a conditional block.  If all of the criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the keywords on the following lines override those set in the global
#              section of the config file, until either another Match line or the end of the file.  If a keyword appears in multiple Match blocks that are satisfied, only the
#              first instance of the keyword is applied.
#
#              The arguments to Match are one or more criteria-pattern pairs or the single token All which matches all criteria.  The available criteria are User, Group, Host,
#              LocalAddress, LocalPort, and Address.  The match patterns may consist of single entries or comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and negation operators
#              described in the PATTERNS section of ssh_config(5).
#
#              The patterns in an Address criteria may additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen format, such as 192.0.2.0/24 or 2001:db8::/32.  Note
#              that the mask length provided must be consistent with the address - it is an error to specify a mask length that is too long for the address or one with bits
#              set in this host portion of the address.  For example, 192.0.2.0/33 and 192.0.2.0/8, respectively.
#
#              Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines following a Match keyword.  Available keywords are AcceptEnv, AllowAgentForwarding, AllowGroups,
#              AllowStreamLocalForwarding, AllowTcpForwarding, AllowUsers, AuthenticationMethods, AuthorizedKeysCommand, AuthorizedKeysCommandUser, AuthorizedKeysFile,
#              AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand, AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser, AuthorizedPrincipalsFile, Banner, ChrootDirectory, ClientAliveCountMax, ClientAliveInterval,
#              DenyGroups, DenyUsers, ForceCommand, GatewayPorts, GSSAPIAuthentication, HostbasedAcceptedKeyTypes, HostbasedAuthentication, HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly,
#              IPQoS, KbdInteractiveAuthentication, KerberosAuthentication, LogLevel, MaxAuthTries, MaxSessions, PasswordAuthentication, PermitEmptyPasswords, PermitOpen,
#              PermitRootLogin, PermitTTY, PermitTunnel, PermitUserRC, PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes, PubkeyAuthentication, RekeyLimit, RevokedKeys, StreamLocalBindMask,
#              StreamLocalBindUnlink, TrustedUserCAKeys, X11DisplayOffset, X11Forwarding and X11UseLocalHost.
